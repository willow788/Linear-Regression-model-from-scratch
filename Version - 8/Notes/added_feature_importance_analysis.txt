1.  Add feature importance analysis that helps you to understand which feature affects the prediction more

## What is Feature Importance Analysis? 
Feature importance analysis identifies which input features (variables) have the strongest influence on the model's predictions. In linear regression, this is typically measured by the magnitude of the coefficients.

## Methods to Calculate Feature Importance: 

### 1. Coefficient Magnitude (Absolute Values)
- Larger absolute coefficient values indicate stronger influence on the target variable
- Formula: importance = |coefficient|
- Note: Features must be scaled/normalized for fair comparison

### 2. Standardized Coefficients
- Multiply coefficients by the standard deviation of each feature
- Formula: standardized_coef = coefficient × std(feature)
- Allows direct comparison even without feature scaling

### 3. Coefficient with Sign
- Positive coefficients: feature increases the target as it increases
- Negative coefficients: feature decreases the target as it increases

## Implementation Considerations:
- Normalize/standardize features before training for accurate importance ranking
- Display importance as percentages or relative rankings
- Visualize with bar plots or sorted tables
- Consider correlation between features (multicollinearity affects interpretation)

## Benefits:
- Understand model behavior and decision-making process
- Identify most influential features for predictions
- Guide feature selection and engineering
- Improve model interpretability for stakeholders
