As discussed before we were still getting a - 0.73 something r^2  value which is sadly not a good score. 
not a good score-- is sort of like an understatement for this score
it is worst than a constant value.

so did the final modifications:
1. earlier y was not standardised or normalised.
( it has been normalised)

2. the learning rate while we we training the mdoel was very less so changed it to 0.01
(main fix)

3. modified the training loop by also adding a gradient bias loss equation that calculates the loss wrt bias

Result:
now the r^2 score skyrocketed to 0.8972106364594717
(this is very close to the perfect score (0.90))

 So, these are the modifications one should do to inprove the r^2 score.
