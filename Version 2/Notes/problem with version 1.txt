the main problem that we encountered in version 1 of this model is that we have a negative r^2 value

what does negative r^2 value means? :
it means---model's predictions are, on average, worse than a simple horizontal line drawn at the mean of the actual data points. 

why are we getting a negative r^2 value ?
because of the following reasons
1. learning rate of the model is too high
2. no of interation is too low.

model = LinearRegression(learn_rate=0.0001, iter=1000)
we are initialising our model like this so, here the no. of iteration is so low and learning rate is so high that the model ends up getting underfitted.

this can be fixed by changing the learing rate to a much smaller value and increasing the number of iterations.

Now we will do these modifications and see how the model has changed it's r^2 score.
